
JasperStarter - Running JasperReports from command line
--------------------------------------------------------

JasperStarter is an opensource command line launcher and batch compiler for
[JasperReports][].

The official homepage is [jasperstater.cenote.de][].

It has the following features:

  * Run any JasperReport that needs a jdbc, csv, xml, json or empty datasource
  * Use with any database for which a jdbc driver is available
  * Run reports with subreports
  * Execute reports that need runtime parameters. Any parameter whose class has
    a string constructor is accepted. Additionally the following types are
    supported or have special handlers:
    * date, image (see usage), locale
  * Optionally prompt for report parameters
  * Print directly to system default or given printer
  * Optionally show printer dialog to choose printer
  * Optionally show printpreview
  * Export to file in the following formats:
    * pdf, rtf, xls, xlsMeta, xlsx, docx, odt, ods, pptx, csv, csvMeta, html, xhtml, xml, jrprint
  * Export multiple formats in one commanding call
  * Compile, print and export in one commanding call
  * View, print or export previously filled reports (use jrprint file as input)
  * Can compile a whole directory of .jrxml files.
  * Integrate in non Java applications (for example PHP, Python)
  * Binary executable on Windows
  * Includes JasperReports so this is the only tool you need to install

Requirements:

  * Java 1.6 or higher
  * A JDBC 2.1 driver for your database


### Quickstart

  * Download JasperStarter from [Sourceforge][].
  * Extract the distribution archive to any directory on your system.
  * Add the _./bin_ directory of your installation to your searchpath (on
    Windows: invoke setup.exe).
  * Put your jdbc drivers in the _./jdbc_ directory of your installation or
    use _\--jdbc-dir_ to point to a different directory.

Invoke JasperStarter with _\-h_ to get an overview:

    $ jasperstarter -h

Invoke JasperStarter with _process \-h_ to get help on the process command:

    $ jasperstarter process -h

Example with reportparameters:

    $ jasperstarter pr report.jasper -t mysql -u myuser -f pdf -H myhost \
     -n mydb -o report -p secret -P CustomerNo=10 StartFrom=2012-10-01

Example with hsql using database type generic:

    $ jasperstarter pr report.jasper -t generic -f pdf -o report -u sa \
    --db-driver org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver \
    --db-url jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost

For more information take a look in the docs directory of the distibution
archive or read the [Usage][] page online.

### Developement

The sourcecode is available at [bitbucket.org/cenote/jasperstarter][], the
project website is hosted at [Sourceforge][].

JasperStarter is build with [Maven][]. 

Unfortunately one dependency (jasperreports-functions) is not provided
in a public maven repository so you must add it to your local maven
repo:

    # Download jasperreports-functions-6.1.0.jar from
    # https://sourceforge.net/projects/jasperreports/files/jasperreports/
    $ jar xvf jasperreports-functions-6.1.0.jar META-INF/maven/net.sf.jasperreports/jasperreports-functions/pom.xml
    $ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jasperreports-functions-6.1.0.jar -DpomFile=META-INF/maven/net.sf.jasperreports/jasperreports-functions/pom.xml

See https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html

It is possible to compile JasperStarter without this dependency but users
will run into errors if they use specific functions in their reports.
So there is a test that fails if jasperreports-functions is not available.

On Linux 64 bit the launch4j-maven-plugin may fail. You need the folloing libs in a 32 bit version:

  * z1
  * ncurses5
  * bz2-1.0

On Ubuntu 14.04 for example use this command:

    $ sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0


To get a distribution package run:

    $ mvn package -P release

or if you build from the current default branch you better use:

    $ mvn package -P release,snapshot

**Attention! You cannot execute** `target/jasperstarter.jar`
**without having it\'s dependencies in** `../lib` ! See **dev** profile below!

If you want to build the Windows setup.exe, you need to have _nsis_ in your
search path (works on linux too, you can find a compiled release in the 
sourceforge download folder _build-tools_ for your convenience)
an add the **windows-setup** profile to your build:

    $ mvn package -P release,windows-setup

or

    $ mvn package -P release,windows-setup,snapshot

While developing you may want to have a quicker build. The **dev** profile
excludes some long running reports and the compressed archives. Instead it puts
the build result into _target/jasperstarter-dev-bin_.

    $ mvn package -P dev

Now you can execute JasperStarter without IDE:

    $ target/jasperstarter-dev-bin/bin/jasperstarter

or

    $ java -jar target/jasperstarter-dev-bin/lib/jasperstarter.jar

During development you might want not to be annoyed by tests. So the following
options are useful:

    $ mvn package -P dev -D skipTests

or

    $ mvn package -P dev -D maven.test.failure.ignore=true

To run JasperStarter from within your IDE add _\--jdbc-dir jdbc_ to the argument
list of your run configuration. Otherwise you will get an error:

    Error, (...)/JasperStarter/target/classes/jdbc is not a directory!

Put your jdbc drivers in the _./jdbc_ directory of the project to invoke
JasperStarter from within your IDE to call up a database based report.
